The Contact Management is a spring boot based application to to maintain basic contact level details .

Before using the application we need to configure the Database details in application.proprties file.

The Login page of the application will be http://localhost:8080 where you need to login to application.
We can set the login UserName and Password in application.properties and system will validate the login as per details configured.
In Further enhancement we can Maintain the Username and password in DB separately
Currently we can login using "admin/admin" as "username/password" details.

On the Index page we can Add Contacts, Update and Delete Contact details.
We can update the contact status as Active/Inactive, where delete contact will completely delete the contact record from Database.

Run the application as a Spring Boot App and after it is started we use the application from web browser on the URL : http://localhost:8080
